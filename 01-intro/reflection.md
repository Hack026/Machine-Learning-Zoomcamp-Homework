# Intro to ML

When I thought about machine learning, I imagined algorithms and heavy math.  
This week shifted my perspective: it begins with **asking the right questions**.  

## What I Learned
- ML vs rule-based systems  
- Basics of supervised learning  
- CRISP-DM for project structure  
- Refreshers on Python, Pandas, NumPy, and linear algebra  

## Key Takeaway
Machine learning isn’t magic-it’s about turning messy problems into something data can answer.  

## Challenge
Revisiting linear algebra after focusing on analytics felt uncomfortable, but I know I’ll need that strength later.  

## Next Step
Dive into regression with the goal of connecting the math to intuition, not just running code.
