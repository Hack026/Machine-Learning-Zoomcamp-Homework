# ML Zoomcamp Journey

This repository documents my learning progress through the **Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2025**.  
It includes both **homework assignments** and my **weekly reflections**.  

## Structure
- `homework/` – coding exercises and assignments from each module  
- `reflections.md` – weekly notes and personal takeaways from the course  

## Why This Repo
My main focus is still **data analytics**, but I’m building a strong foundation in machine learning.  
This repo helps me:
1. Stay consistent with weekly updates  
2. Reflect on challenges and insights  
3. Share my learning in public  

## Progress
- [Module 1 – Intro](./01-intro)
- [Module 2 – Regression](./02-regression) (coming soon)
